## SpaceXData

A React web application that shows data from the Space X API. The front page shows basic data about Space X and their mission statement, as well as a section that shows the time and date of the next launch. On the other pages there is a section that allows you to search for Space X launches which you can filter by a date range or by what type of rocket was launched.
